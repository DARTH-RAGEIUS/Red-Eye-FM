              <h2>HISTORY OF CANNABIS IN KENYA</h2>
              <p>Cannabis has been grown in Kenya for centuries and was valued not only for its practical and medical benefits, but in religious ritual too. The Luo people of western Kenya (who the Obama family are related to) traditionally smoked cannabis from hollowed-out gourds, as a way of communicating with their ancestors. They believed that the spirits of their ancestors protected their cannabis plantations. It was also common practice for many Kenyan households to have a small amount of cannabis on hand at all times, for ritual and medicinal purposes. It is not known how many landrace cannabis varieties grow in Kenya, as the Kenyans do not have an export market. Some enthusiasts, however, have obtained seeds from the country and developed commercial strains from them. One commercial strain is Kilimanjaro, which was developed from the plants growing on the eastern foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro.</p>
              <p>The majority of the landrace cannabis plants in Kenya are pure sativa and produce speedy, almost psychedelic highs. The main cultivation zones include the central highlands around Mount Kenya, the basin of Lake Victoria, and the coastal areas. Around 1,500 hectares is devoted to growing it. Although there is a small domestic market, most of the cannabis in Kenya is imported from Tanzania and Uganda. The law states that owning even small amounts of cannabis a crime, let alone supplying significant amounts to others. Despite this, there is a thriving illegal cannabis market in Nairobi, the country’s capital. At Korogocho, bags of cannabis are hidden amongst farm produce to prevent detection. Most of this cannabis, or bhang, as the locals call it, has been smuggled in from Tanzania, or even as far away as Ethiopia. </p>
              <p>Some people also grow cannabis, in spite of the risks. In a slum in Upper Savanna, for example, people grow it in between sugarcane and tall grass, which serves to conceal it. When it comes to people’s attitudes about cannabis, opinions are divided. Some want the government to adopt South Africa’s stance and legalise cannabis for recreational use, and others are concerned about the perceived health risks. The high-profile petitions, not to mention Ken Okoth’s proposed Marijuana Bill, suggests that changes may be underway in Kenya. The 2018 decriminalisation of cannabis in South Africa is likely to have had some impact, and growing public pressure may also convince the Kenyan government to take action.However, while it seems likely that medicinal cannabis will be permitted eventually, it may take longer to address the negative perceptions surrounding its recreational use. Only time will tell if the petitions are successful or not. </p>

              <h2>CANNABIS LAWS IN KENYA</h2>
              <p>Can you possess and use cannabis in Kenya? Kenya’s Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act states that: “Any person who has in his possession any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance shall be guilty of an offence.” This includes cannabis. According to the law, if the court decides that the offender only had cannabis for their own personal use, they may be given a prison sentence of ten years. Although this seems harsh, it is considerably less than the punishment for other illegal drugs, which incur a prison sentence of twenty years to life. In reality, you’re more likely to receive an on-the-spot fine, which, due to the levels of corruption in the country , may end up being pocketed by the arresting officers. </p>
              <p>Can you sell cannabis in Kenya?As you might imagine, selling cannabis in Kenya is also illegal. If the court decides that the amount of cannabis you have in your possession is for supply (rather than personal use), you could be subject to a prison sentence of 20 years to life . You could also be given a fine of one million shillings or “three times the market value” of the cannabis, whichever is larger. </p>
              <p>Can you grow cannabis in Kenya? Growing cannabis is illegal too. It’s against the law to cultivate it, and you must not allow others to cultivate it on your land or in your property. If the police find that you’re involved in cannabis cultivation, you could be liable to a fine of 250,000 shillings or three times the market value of the cannabis, whichever is greater. Alternatively, you may be given a prison sentence (up to 20 years) or both. If you own the land that the cannabis was grown on, the ownership of the land is forfeited to the government. Lately, the world has been rooting for the legalization of bhang. Some states in the U.S have already legalized the farming, distribution, and consumption of weed. In Africa, a wind of change over Marijuana is sweeping over countries, leaving radical reforms in its wake. Three countries, so far, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and South Africa, have made it legal to grow marijuana in a bid to tap into the billion-dollar sector that is expanding rapidly. In Kenya, this conversation has been going on for some time now. It has attracted support and criticism in equal measure, with the former Kibra MP, the Late Hon. Ken Okoth, giving notice of the introduction of Marijuana Control Bill 2018 in the National Assembly. This bill seeks to decriminalize the use of weed and create regulations that will control the growth and use of bhang in Kenya. It might not be general knowledge that Okoth's bid to legalize bhang in Kenya is not the first attack levelled against the restrictive laws on bhang use. In April 2017 and March 2018, two Kenyan researchers, Simon Mwaura and Gwada Ogot, petitioned parliament to legalize weed. They were, however, met with unmitigated opposition from leaders, with Mutula Kilonzo Jr being one of the greatest opposers of the petition by the two researchers. </p>

              <p>Let’s talk about one of the common side-effects of hitting a blunt. If you’ve ever visited a KFC drive-thru after smoking weed, you’ll know that the munchies are a very real thing. But why exactly do the munchies happen? Well, a study in Nature Neuroscience explains a few things, which help us understand how marijuana’s acitive ingredient THC makes us extra hungry. A team of European neuroscientists led by Giovanni Marsicano of the University of Bordeaux used mice to find out why we feel so peckish after a joint. To do this, they exposed mice to banana and almond oils as a test of sensitivity to scent. The mice sniffed the oils deeply at first, and then stopped showing interest in them. However when they were dosed with THC, they kept on sniffing, and ate much more when they were given the chance.</p>
              <p>According to the scientists, THC fits into receptors in the brain’s olfactory bulb, significantly increasing the animals’ ability to smell food and leading them to eat more of it. It seems that a part of the reason why you eat more when you’re high is because you can smell and taste more acutely. THC fits into receptors that are part of the brain’s natural endocannabinoid system, which helps to control emotions, memory, pain sensitivity and appetite. Our brains do produce their own chemicals that fit into these same receptors – but THC can alter them in big ways.</p>
              <p>In theory, the study found that the reason our appetites are so big when we’re high is simply because the THC increases our sensitivity to the smells of food, and because smell and taste are closely related, it allows us to taste better, too – which could also explain why we fancy certain foods more when we’re high, because certain smells and tastes are stronger than others. So basically, we get the munchies because we are super aware of the smells around us, and the THC offers stronger tastes, too. A previous study suggests that smoking marijuana can make us crave food even when we’ve just eaten, by chucking in endorphins when our body is telling us we’re full. </p>
              <p>That leads to more frequent, small meals rather than a big dinner – hence all your grazing on tortilla chips and salsa. The munchies as a concept are also backed up by analysis from March this year , which found that the legalisation of recreational marijuana in states like Colorado, Oregon, and Washington led to a 3.1% increase in ice cream purchases, a 4.1% increase in cookie purchases, and a 5.3% increase in crisp purchases soon after weed was made legally available to buy.  - Toker Tyronne </p>
